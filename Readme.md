# MongoDb Setup

* Run docker-compose.yml
* and then go to mongodb container
* and then authenticate using password and username
* and then create collections(orders and products)
* and then switch to db (i.e. which you are going to connect).
* and then create new user. (The code sample (mongosetting.txt)  is mentioned inside backend-ordermgt folder)
* now you can connect mongo db using new username and password
* connection url : mongodb://`<username>:<password>@<hostname>:<portnumber>/<dbname>`
